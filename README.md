02-Homework_01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor_Noha Ashraf

Project Objective:
    •	Refactor an existing code for Horiseon Website 
Approach:
    •	Review and replace the <div> element with semantic HTML elements that fits the final website
    •	Review the structure of the HTML elements
    •	Adding alt attributes to the images 
    •	Review the title of the HTML
    •	Review the CSS
Adjustments:
    •	Replaced all the <div> elements with the following elements 
        o	<header>
        o	<nav>
        o	<main>
        o	<article>
        o	<aside>
        o	<section>
        o	<footer>
    •	Made sure that all the above elements were in a logical order that reflects the webpage
    •	Added alt attributes
        o	The image under the header has a title added to it, as per my research if the image is in included as a background in the CSS file, then the alt  attribute alternative is adding a title to the anchor in the html file
        o	Added alt attributes to the images in the main section, described as much as possible
        o	Added an empty alt attribute to the figures on the right as I did not feel that they are informative or very descriptive to the text
    •	Title of the HTML
        o	Changed the title to reflect the website
    •	Linked the first navigation “search engine optimization” through an id given to the corresponding article
    •	Changed the h2 in the footer to be h4 for logical sequence
    •	Created one class in the main section and one class in the aside section to consolidate the CSS
    •	CSS
        o	Consolidated the CSS based on the new classes assigned in the html
        o	Rearranged the CSS to follow the same sequence of the html and the website

Conclusion:
  •	The code is:
        o	Formatted
        o	Used semantic elements
        o	Follows logical structure
        o	Images have alt attributes
        o	CSS consolidated
        o	Headings following a sequence
        o	Website title changed to reflect the content
